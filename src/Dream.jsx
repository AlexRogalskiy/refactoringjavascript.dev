              What if you knew how to clean up code while you deliver value to
              your customers?
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine being able to dive into any kind of JavaScript codebase,
              knowing that you can fix problems safely. You come in and know
              that you can:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-numeric pl-4 italic">
              <li>Detect code smells and address them</li>
              <li>Make safe changes without having tests</li>
              <li>Update the code so we can easily write the missing tests</li>
              <li>
                Stop refactoring at any time, change my mind, or just ship!
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Refactoring code is what you do <u>while shipping changes</u>. You
              don't need to ask for permission. Each new feature is now an
              opportunity to make the code easier to maintain!
            </p>
            <p>
              You didn't suddenly become a genius developer. But you master safe
              refactoring techniques. From the outside, it just looks
              impressive!

        What if refactoring was second nature to you?

              Saving a file you changed. Switch to your browser to see these
              changes. Opening up your terminal. Creating a new component.
            </p>
            <p>
              These actions are <strong>small</strong> and{" "}
              <strong>you're used to doing them</strong>. You probably don't
              even think about it anymore!
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine you knew <strong>refactoring moves</strong> that would be{" "}
              <strong>fast and safe</strong> to execute. You'd get so familiar
              with them that you would do them <em>instinctively</em>.

            <p>
              How would it change the way you work? How would you feel if you
              could ship features in time AND improve the code?
            </p>
            <p>
              Sure. Your teammates may still not care and keep creating a mess
              behind themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              But would you care if you could recover from any mayhem in front
              of you?

              Managers won't notice anything but the quality of your work. Your
              colleagues will learn from reading your commits. You will lead the
              path to a better codebase, by paving the way.Â ðŸ§±
