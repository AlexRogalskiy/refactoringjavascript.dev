        The first edition was published in 1999. These were battle-tested for
        years, in the trenches! I have been successfully using these across the
        projects I've had to work with.

        You know what these projects had in common? You got it. Legacy

        It's not just "refactoring".

      <p>
        It's about following <strong>precise</strong> steps that maximize the
        safety of your changes. Small, specific moves that do one thing, and do
        it well.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's about being a professional JavaScript developer who can clean code
        while shipping value to customers every single time.

        I'm a big fan of personal productivity tips and adopting great habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I've put up a course to teach you these refactoring moves, in the
        right order, at the right pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following this course, you'll learn how to:
        <ul className="list-disc">
          <li>clean up code, as you go</li>
          <li>ship features in time</li>
          <li>
            make it easy to finally put this code under tests, without tests!
          </li>
          <li>
            go back and forth different coding styles, molding JS to your will
          </li>
          <li>be confident in your skills to tame any JavaScript codebase</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        You won't just read some theory and code. You'll be guided to actively
        create new habits! These moves will become part of your reflexes when
        coding, so you don't even <em>think</em> about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If dealing with a tangled JavaScript behemot is your daily life, this
        will make it brighter.
