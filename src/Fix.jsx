        A proven way to make changes easier.
      </h3>
      <p>
        When people say "refactoring", they usually mean "I've rewritten part of
        the code. Hopefully, it's better!"
      </p>
      <p>
        In his book, Martin Fowler defined refactoring as changing the structure
        of the code without changing its observable behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are <strong>refactoring recipes</strong> that you can follow to
        transform your code <strong>safely</strong>. Fowler's published the
        first edition of his book in 1999!
      </p>
      <p>
        These have then been battle-tested for years, in the trenches! They will
        change the way you approach untested and undocumented code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fixing a bug is not refactoring. Improving a feature is not refactoring.
        But here, you will learn how you can refactor, so fixing a bug is easy
        and improving a feature is safe!
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-medium text-slate-headline text-mobile-h3 lg:text-desktop-h3">
        A safer way to change code.
      </h3>
      <p>
        It's about following <strong>precise</strong> steps that maximize the
        safety of your changes. Small, specific moves that do one thing, and do
        it well.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's about being a professional JavaScript developer who can clean code
        while shipping value to customers every single time.
      </p>

        I call that:{" "}
        <em>
          <strong>Atomic Refactorings</strong>
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this course, you will learn all the little refactoring moves that are
        useful to tackle any kind of JavaScript application!

        Learn faster, retain longer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I learn best when I can experiment myself. Reading a catalog of
        refactorings is nice, but it really clicked after I spent years figuring
        how to use these on actual code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the 61 refactoring moves you could learn, some of them are more
        useful than others. Some are more common to use in JavaScript. You also
        get better results when you learn them in a specific orderâ€¦
      </p>
      <p>
        This course spread refactoring moves in different modules. Thus, you
        start with the simplest and most valuable ones. The essentials!
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, as you progress through the course, you will get more options to
        address technical debt. Larger moves will allow you to transform
        codebases at scale!
      </p>
      <p>
        This course is based on experience working with JS code, front-end, and
        back-end. I'm giving you all the tools you need to hone your refactoring
        skills:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc">
        <li>a learning path that makes sense</li>
        <li>step-by-step transformation of the code</li>
        <li>recordings of me performing each move on concrete code</li>
        <li>
          interactive playgrounds tailored for each move, where you will
          practice and improve your mastering
        </li>
        <li>cheat sheets and tips for the combo you can use</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="font-medium text-slate-headline text-mobile-h3 lg:text-desktop-h3">
        You will learn a new habit.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'm really into personal productivity and habits. Getting Things Done,
        Atomic Habits, Deep Work, etc. I've read all of that!
      </p>
      <p>
        Your journey starts when you get into this course. I want to support you
        all along the way. You won't just be learning moves. You will be
        following a path that I've optimized for turning these lessons into
        concrete actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good habits make you do the right things, without you having to think
        about it.
      </p>
      <p>You will adopt the habit of refactoring code!</p>
      <h3 className="font-medium text-slate-headline text-mobile-h3 lg:text-desktop-h3">
        Step up your JavaScript game with professional moves!
      </h3>
      <p>Following this course, you'll learn how to:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc">
        <li>clean up code, as you go</li>
        <li>ship features in time</li>
        <li>
          make it easy to finally put this code under tests, without tests!
        </li>
        <li>
          go back and forth different coding styles, molding JS to your will
        </li>
        <li>be confident in your skills to tame any JavaScript codebase</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You won't just read some theory and code. You'll be guided to actively
        create new habits! These moves will become part of your reflexes when
        coding, so you don't even <em>think</em> about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If dealing with a tangled JavaScript behemoth is your daily life, then
        this will make it brighter!
