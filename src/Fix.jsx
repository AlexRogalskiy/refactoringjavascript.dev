          When people say "refactoring", they usually mean "I've rewritten part
          of the code. Hopefully, it's better!"
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-xl leading-9 antialiased font-normal">
          In his book, Martin Fowler defined refactoring as changing the
          structure of the code without changing its observable behavior.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-xl leading-9 antialiased font-normal">
          There are <strong>refactoring recipes</strong> that you can follow to
          transform your code <strong>safely</strong>. Fowler's published the
          first edition of his book in 1999!

        <p className="mt-6 text-xl leading-9 antialiased font-normal">
          These have then been battle-tested for years, in the trenches! They
          will change the way you approach untested and undocumented code.

        <p className="mt-6 text-xl leading-9 antialiased font-normal">
          Fixing a bug is not refactoring. Improving a feature is not
          refactoring. But here, you will learn how you can refactor, so fixing
          a bug is easy and improving a feature is safe!

          I learn best when I can experiment myself. Reading a catalog of
          refactorings is nice, but it really clicked after I spent years
          figuring how to use these on actual code.

          Among the 61 refactoring moves you could learn, some of them are more
          useful than others. Some are more common to use in JavaScript. You
          also get better results when you learn them in a <u>specific</u>{" "}
