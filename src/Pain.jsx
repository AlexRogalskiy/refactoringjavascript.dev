            <p>
              Yeah, you've heard that. You <em>know</em> tests could help. But
              still:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-decimal">
              <li>
                Adding tests for this would itself require a MAJOR refactoring
                of the entire codebase!
              </li>
              <li>
                Deadlines are short. Would you really have time for this? You
                aren't so sure of thisâ€¦
              </li>
              <li>
                Your team already asked to freeze features for a while, so you
                can clean up the code. But this isn't happening soonâ€¦
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              So you resort to what you know how to do: be extra careful, touch
              the less possible amount of code. Try out some stuff manually.
              Cross fingers.

              If only! This code is a twisted, tangled spaghetti soup. The last
              time you tried renaming a model attribute, half of the routes
              stopped working!Â ðŸ¤¬

            <p>
              Changing code here is like playing Russian Roulette on a roll. Do
              you feel lucky today?
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's face it. What this codebase really needs is a good
              Refactoring Sprint or two. At least, that's what your colleagues
              say.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you ever experienced that kind of "refactor the codebase"
              attempt, you may have been leftâ€¦ doubtful.
            </p>
            <p>
              How good are 3,000 lines of code spread across 30 methods where{" "}
              <code>fooN()</code> just calls <code>fooN+1()</code> in its last
              line? Great, now you have to jump all around to understand what's
              going on! So much for "coding new features faster".
            </p>
            <p>
              Other devs say they want to refactor the code all the time. They
              look confident and all. But after they have touched the code, the
              result is often worseâ€¦
