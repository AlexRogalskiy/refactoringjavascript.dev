            Yeah, you've heard that. You know tests could help, but:
            <ul className="list-decimal">
              <li>
                Adding tests to this code itself requires a MAJOR refactoring of
                the entire codebase!
              </li>
              <li>
                Deadlines are short, you don't really think you have time for
                thisâ€¦
              </li>
              <li>
                You already asked to freeze features for a while, so you can
                clean up the code. But this won't happen soonâ€¦

          <p>
            If you're just being careful and touch the less possible amount of
            code, maybe that would work?

            If only! This code is a twisted, tangled spaghetti soup. The last
            time you tried renaming a model attribute, half of the routes
            stopped working!Â ðŸ¤¬

          <p>
            What this codebase really need is a good Refactoring Sprint or two.
            At least, that's what your colleagues say.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have experienced some of these "refactor the codebase"
            attempts, you may have been leftâ€¦ well, doubtful.
          </p>
          <p>
            How good are 3,000 lines of code spread across 30 methods where{" "}
            <code>fooN()</code> just calls <code>fooN+1()</code> in its last
            line? Great, now you have to jump all around to understand what's
            going on! So much for not wasting your time when coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other developers say they want to refactor the code all the time.
            They look confident and all. But after they have touched the code,
            the result is often worseâ€¦
