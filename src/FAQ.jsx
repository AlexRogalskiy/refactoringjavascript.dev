      {/* TODO: what's the difference with Fowler's book? Showing you moves + interactive playground is obvious. More subtle is that I've been a fullstack JS dev for a decade, and I know some patterns are more idiomatic than others. Fowler uses JS snippets to illustrate the moves. I'm tailoring the moves to JS developers. Learning path is adapted, some moves I even dropped. Most moves I show you how to do it with just functions and objects vs. classesâ€”although I also show you how classes can be good in JS when used properly. */}

        <dt>Will the content of this course be updated?</dt>
        <dd>
          Yes! I will keep this course up-to-date to stay relevant with new
          techniques and JavaScript syntax. Most of what you'll learn will be
          evergreen anyway, but I'll make sure things don't get outdated. I may
          even add content, if relevant.

            My goal is to teach you skills that will make you code faster and
            safer, regardless of the framework you're dealing with. I'm sure
            you'll love it!

          <p>This course is extremely valuable if you are:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>Working with JavaScript/TypeScript code</li>
            <li>Dealing with code that is poorly tested</li>
            <li>Under pressure to deliver features and bug fixes on time</li>
            <li>In a scenario where "rewrite" isn't an option</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You'll find it useful if you want to improve the way you work: adopt
            great habits to make you stand out as a JS developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have read Martin Fowler's Refactoring book (not required) but
            felt you didn't get the most of it, then my course will guide you in
            a comprehensive way through the content.

          <p>This course is probably NOT for you if:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>
              You already have read Refactoring and you're applying it in your
              daily job
            </li>
            <li>
              You already adopted the habit of making tiny refactorings to make
              the change easy
            </li>
            <li>
              You already practice micro-committing and the Mikado Method with
              ease

            This course will teach you Atomic Refactorings. You'll get into the
            habit of doing safe changes that don't change the behavior of the
            code.
          </p>
          <p>
            That can help you make changes easier. It can also help you refactor
            code enough so you can finally run it under a test harness.
          </p>
          <p>This course will not teach you:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc">
            <li>
              How to do large-scale architectural changes. But you'll know
              atomic moves you may compose into bigger refactorings yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refactorings that are specific to React/Vue/Svelte/Angular/etc.
              I'll teach you to deal with generic JavaScript code, not a
              framework in particular.
            </li>
            <li>How to test JavaScript code.</li>

            by Kent C. Dodds for that. It's a great complimentary. My course
            helps you make Legacy Code testable, and make changes easier in
            general.

            If you want to do so, please suggest your teammates purchase their
            own individual access. Maybe you can get your client/employer to
            cover the expense.
