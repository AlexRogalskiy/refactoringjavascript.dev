# Refactoring JavaScript: Playground

This is the source code for the interactive playground I built for the [Refactoring JavaScript](https://refactoringjavascript.dev/) courseÂ ðŸŽ“

This playground tells you how long the code is in a broken state. Your goal is to refactor the code AND keep this score to a minimum.

The Atomic Refactorings movements I teach you in the course help you transform the code while keeping the code working at all time. When you master that, you are able to **improve the code quality AND ship at any time**!

_Note: the code isn't public yet, because I'm building a Proof Of Concept for now._
