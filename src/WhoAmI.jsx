          I started my career on the front-end side, building jQuery plugins and
          UIs. I progressively included back-end JavaScript when Node.js became
          a thing. I've then been a freelancer, consultant, and Tech Lead across
          different projects. I pushed different styles of code to production,
          from Backbone.js to Angular, going by Cycle.js… These past 4 years
          have mostly been React. 😃

          I was a huge Webstorm user but moved to VS Code because I prefer how
          versatile it is.

          I like when things are practical. I do my best to give tricks you can
          use, and tips that can help. I think practice makes perfect. Do early,
          do often, iterate from the feedback!

          That's why, with this course, I wish to teach you what I learned in
          the best possible way, so you can quickly get concrete results. 🏃
